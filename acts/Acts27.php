<center> <h1> January 20 -- Acts 27 </h1> </center>

<p> Hello friends!! </p>

<p> Hope that the new year is treating you all well :) And yes, here's the penultimate chapter of Acts! (So unless we have an exponentially increasing gap between updates, we should be set :) ) </p>

<p> I was really intrigued by Tuna's remark on Acts 26, on if Paul would have actually had more freedom to spread the Gospel in Rome if he wasn't there in chains. I feel like I've been brought up on this idea that Paul had to be in chains - from the prophesies to that fact, to his steadfast following of Christ regardless of where it led his human self, to the many letters he wrote from Roman prisons. But what if he chose to not appeal to Ceasar, and instead resolved the case with King Agrippa? How would that change Christianity as we know it today? Would we be able to see a much greater spread of Paul's students, or a faster planting of the church in the late Roman empire? </p>

<p> (Aside, Acts 25:19-20 seemed particularly funny to me: "Instead, they had some points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a dead man named Jesus who Paul claimed was alive. I was at a loss how to investigate such matters..." - I can really just picture an overworked beuracrat with no clue how to handle this bizarre case before him!) </p>

<p> But on further reflection, I don't think this kind of "what aboutism"/speculation is particularly useful in this case, since it doesn't really bring me to better understand the nature of God, but is instead more of like a historical point-of-fact. I think that reflects a similar change in regards to how I view the Bible itself - not as a puzzle to be figured out logically for maximum utility, but as a human expression of the nature of God, through imperfect language and multiple translations. IDK if that's particularly helpful (it almost seems to me that I'm just avoiding the question!), but would love to hear your thoughts :)) </p>

<p> okay onwards to... </p>
<p> Acts 27 seems like a page straight out of Robinson Crusoe, filled with the nautical adventures of Paul as he is being taken to Rome. I feel like I got three key takeaways here: </p>
<p> 1) We sometimes want to rush ahead, even when that takes us on a longer path (vv9-12) </p>
<p> Paul advises the crew to winter in the harbor in Lasea, rather than trying to push along, but the centurion and the crew do not listen to him. On first glance, this seems entirely reasonable - after all, Paul's credentials are in the law and in religion, not on navigating the Meditarrarean Sea. I think we often do the same thing in reference to God - allowing Him to be part of our spiritual life, but shutting Him out of the parts of life where we think we already have some amount of knowledge or mastery over. </p>
<p> 2) God is merciful in the storm! (vv13-38) </p>
<p> Even in the worst of the storm, God is there and is merciful. He rescues the entire crew, and through Paul encourages them to be well fed before running aground on the island. Even when other sailors have already given up on their own lives, ready to gamble on the waves, He is there for us. </p>
<p> 3) Even after receiving God's good grace, we still want to rebel (vv39-44) </p>
<p> The sailors still wanted to kill Paul when they got to the island! Even though Paul was the one who reassured them during the storm... I feel like it's easy to look down on those sailors, yet I sometimes feel the same. After difficulties have passed, instead of reflecting on what had gotten me through it, I try to move forwards as quickly as possible. I think this passage really helps illustrate exactly why that's a bad idea. </p>

<p> Hope y'all are enjoying your MLK weekends, and to see all of you sometime soon! </p>
