<center> <h1> July 1 -- Acts 7 </h1> </center>

<p> Hi everyone! Thanks for sharing about Acts so far (and updating the rest of us about your personal lives)! </p>

<p> Acts 7 covers Stephen's trail, both his defense and his death by stoning. </p>

<p> It's a decently long chapter, primarily because Stephen spends a long time recapping major OT stories, including the lives of Abraham, Joseph, Moses, and David. At first, I wondered why Stephen felt the need to recap all this (kinda like those "Previously, on TV Show X..." segments you get at the start of an episode lol), but it all clicked into place after I went backwards to read the charge Stephen is under trial for: "and they set up false witnesses who said, 'This man never ceases to speak words against this holy place and the law, for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs that Moses delivered to us'" [6:13-14]. So people are accusing Stephen of speaking blasphemy against Jewish law and customs that they hold in high regard. </p>

<p> The point I got from Stephen's entire speech is that the accusers are full of hypocrisy, and so were generations of their ancestors before them. While they and their ancestors are by ethnic identity members of God's chosen people, in practice they don't act like it be being constantly disobedient. While they claim to treat God-given law and customs as holy/sacred, in practice they don't live according to the law.  </p>
<p> "You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did, so do you. Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered, you who received the law as delivered by angels and did not keep it." [7:51-53]  </p>
<p> "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it!..." [Luke 13:34] </p>
<p> "...I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and persecute, so that the blood of all the prophets, shed from the foundation of the world, may be charged against this generation, from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation." [Luke 11:49-51] </p>

<p> The existing Jewish authorities in Stephen's time were religious in their facade, but spiritually empty in real life. In contrast, the early church established a better role model - full of boldness, faith, obedience and truth. I think one of the reasons this chapter is so powerful is that it can be used to shine a light on our own spiritual life, and more broadly the spiritual well-being of our local church body. Are we more like the Jewish authorities - stubborn in our refusal to receive spiritual correction and repent - or like the early church and Stephen? This message has been personally convicting, this week being rather difficult re: struggling w/ feelings of lust, and on a more macro level in light of the church's historical and current sins (e.g colonialism, the Catholic sex abuse scandal) we would do well to be vigilant in making sure we are not a "stiff-necked people". </p>

<p> Some other notes: </p>
<p> - Stephen is the last straw; after his stoning persecution intensifies so much the church is scattered out from Jerusalem. As we've seen and will see, boldness in faith can result in real persecution and suffering (although in Jesus we can cling to an otherworldly joy that can't be taken away. "Then they left the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy dishonor for the name." [5:41]") </p>
<p> - there's a jarring balance between rebuke and grace in Stephen's speech ("You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears..." [7:51] vs. "...Lord, do not hold this sin against them" [7:60]); it reminds me of Jesus' ministry as he strongly rebukes and warmly receives sinners at different times in his life. </p>

<p> Hope y'all are doing well! Some random life updates from the past week or so: a) Tuan's visiting this weekend! b) I was reading a book and came across mention of an Indonesian-born person named Li Denghui who was Class of 1899, 120 years before us *surprised Pikachu face* i.e I think I just found the first Indonesian Yalie (even though Indonesia wasn't even a thing back then lol) </p>

<p> Cheers, </p>
