<center> <h1> July 4 -- Acts 9 </h1> </center>

<p> Hi all, and happy independence day! I decided to forgo the heat/rain/crowds/police in DC today, and instead cooked and biked and rested :) Hope today was restful for you guys as well! </p>

<p> A quick note on Acts 8: I thought it was really interesting how these three conversion stories (Simon, the eunuch (who goes unnamed?!), and Saul) back to back to back. We definitely see a lot of differences in each of them - Simon is very rooted in the Earthly way of thinking, where things need to be bought. I can definitely see from his perspective - such a wonderful gift ought to be deserving of money, yet Peter rebukes Simon for thinking in that way. Then we have the eunuch, who immediately decides to get baptized by Philip after reading the old testament together, and finally we have Saul. </p>

<p> I was recently reading Acts 8 while studying Romans, so this part of Saul/Paul was really on my mind. But what I noticed on this reading was the role of Ananias and his reluctance to go help Saul. It really reminded me of the book of Jonah, and the reluctance of Jonah to act, also because of his knowledge of the Lord's mercy. It makes me realize how often we want justice in our own way, and not want to submit to the love and mercy of the Lord (even though we would be nothing without that very mercy!) </p>

<p> Versus 26-27 also resonated with me - where Paul, a changed man at this point, tried to get closer with the disciples, but the disciples were fearful. It feels like they have every right to be fearful, especially for a person who essentially executed Stephen and persecuted Christians to no end. But Paul finds favor in their eyes for what he had given up and the tribulations that he faced to preach the word. </p>

<p> And finally, the resurrection of Tabitha! I'm honestly surprised that this passage is not covered more often. It's one of the few resurrections we see in the New Testament, and I think it's the only one that is not performed by Christ, right? It truly is a miraculous sign, although I'm not certain what to take away from it, other than the power of faith and belief. </p>

<p> Recently, the College Park community group has been praying for one of our members - he hurt his knee really badly almost two weeks ago, and he is still waiting to get an appointment for a MRI. (His primary care doctor said that it was inconclusive and referred him, but paperwork was slowed down with the holiday...) We've been praying for healing for him every week during the community group, which I've found to be really powerful and moving. </p>

<p> Looking forwards to hearing from yall soon! </p>
