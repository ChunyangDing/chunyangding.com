<p> Phew, thanks for being patient y’all 😊 I’ve been thinking about what Tuna wrote re: Paul’s obedience to God even in a dream-like state, and I took it as a challenge to examine my heart/thoughts toward God. The conclusion from my mini-experiment over the last couple days is that it’s so difficult to achieve the 2 Cor 10:5 call: 5 We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ. </p>

<p> Whether that’s with the way that I respond to my parents, to the way I spend my spare time, to the way that I approach sins in my life, its remarkable to note how little control I have over my thoughts! That raises the question... if my thoughts aren’t obedient to Christ, then to what are they obedient? My desires? pressures from other people? you get the idea. If you haven’t already, I’d suggest taking some time over the next couple days to run this experiment yourselves and see how your thoughts and desires are shaped! </p>

<p> Now onto some scattered thoughts on Acts: In Iconium and in Lystra, we see how a small number of unbelievers come and “poison minds” of the new believers, which results in further division between the Jews and the apostles. I think that follows the natural tide of opposition to the gospel, and so we should pay particular attn to receive good teaching in the midst of false teachers... </p>

<p> Vv 8-18, I find it interesting how the priests of Zeus sought to crown Barnabas and Paul as their God in human form. The people are looking for the divine in things all around them, and this searching attitude leads them to think the apostles are Gods. The apostles are doing things in the power of the Holy Spirit, which everybody recognizes as truly divine! They've just missed the mark in identifying the one true God. </p>

<p> v. 15-16: we serve a living God, not one of vain things. The rains from heaven, fruitful seasons, satisfaction from food, and gladness all serve as witness to God’s reality. I’d like to carry that with me this week. </p>

<p> When Paul’s stoned nearly to death, he gets up, goes back, and preaches to the people who nearly killed him. crazy. God has opened “a door of faith to the Gentiles.” amen! </p>
