<center> <h1> September 2 -- Acts 20 </h1> </center>

<p> Hi everyone! </p>

<p> Apologies again for the delay! So many friendly faces in the SF meet-up :) Thanks for letting me know about Sreejan, I'll try to meet him during orientation! In terms of life updates, I have finally arrived at my room in Princeton last night! Before, I've been wrapping up my research project with a last minute upgrade and shopping classes at Yale, which was quite confusing for some that knew I shouldn't be in a Yale classroom anymore! The ending was stretched for me, but I think I'm finally closing the chapter of Yale. </p>

<p> Acts 20: </p>
<p> Paul departs from Ephesus and continues his journey towards Macedonia and Greece. He stays in Troas for a week, where he witnesses the miracle of a man named Eutychus raised from the dead. As I understand from the study bible notes, Eutychus got sleepy during Paul's long sermon, went to the window to get some air and still fell asleep, which resulted him falling off from the third story! It is told that the man is "taken up dead". I was a bit confused on how Eutychus is revived in what followed. It is written that Paul takes him in his arms and says "Do not be alarmed, for his life is in him" (Acts 20:10). It sounds like he is merely reporting his condition. We do not know if a prayer was involved, but we do see care in Paul's actions, earlier in the same verse "But Paul went down and bent over him, and taking him in his arms, said..." Since there is no verbal prayer before the miracle, I wonder if this passage points to Paul's actions as a prayer. Alternatively, we could question if Paul's presence did not have to do with the revival, but my guess is that there would be. </p>

<p> As Paul hopes to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost, he decides not to stop in Ephesus and instead calls for the elders of the church in Ephesus to meet him in Miletus. There he parts from them, telling that he will never get to see them again. It sounds like the essence of his speech is to be a reminder of his time with them (his sharing of the gospel and his conduct among them) and warning for the trials of the future. The line that stood out to me particularly was this one "Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish every one with tears." (Acts 20:31) It's a very loving picture that in admonishing people, he shares the grief of the situation, rather than stay detached from the person. This reminds me again that while Paul is well-versed in the Old Testament and understands God's plan of salvation at an intellectual level, his ministry is strongly connected to his heart. I recently saw in his letter to Corinthians, "If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but I have not love, I am nothing. If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing." (1 Corinthians 13:1-3) I had the sense that Paul's love is evident in his ministry. </p>

<p> We also see that Paul is going to Jerusalem, knowing that he should go there and knowing that afflictions await him. "And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, constrained by the Spirit, not knowing what will happen to me there, except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me." (Acts 20:22-23). This reminded me of his words "Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ" (Corinthians 11:1) I think reading Acts 20 made it more concrete for me that Paul is imitating Christ. As Jesus knew of the death that awaited him and obeyed the Father, Paul knows that there will be afflictions awaiting him and obeys the Spirit. </p>

<p> I hope you've all been doing well and had a restful day today :) </p>

<p> Best, </p>
