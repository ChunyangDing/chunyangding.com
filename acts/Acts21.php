<p> Hi all!! </p>

<p> It's been a minute - hope you are all still doing well! It's odd - my life is no longer pegged to the regular academic calendar, yet it feels markedly different moving from summer towards fall. Perhaps it's just a mindset, or just settling into this community more and more, but it is nice to feel more at home these days :) </p>

<p> Acts 21 is a pretty wild ride more or less keeping the camera aimed at Paul as he marches to his own imprisonment. I was somewhat surprised by how many warnings Paul received along the way from Earthly sources - whether it be the group of disciples who "through the Spirit" urge him not to keep going (v4) or the prophet Agabus, who binds himself with Paul's belt (v11). In this, it seems like Paul is incredibly Christ-like - the full acknowledgement of God's will, the knowledge that it would be painful and humiliating, yet the drive to continue allowing His will be done. </p>

<p> I think that's still the biggest spiritual block in my life - my own desire for security and peace overriding what God's plans are for me. This still mostly manifests itself in forms of insecurity - especially insecurity of money, or of things that are outside my own control (ie, parent's stability). It becomes more difficult for me to calm myself and bring myself to God's word when I become too self-centered, and not self-sacrificing, as Paul was. </p>

<p> How are all of y'all doing? Does it feel like this season has brought more stability, or more change? </p>

<p> In Christ, </p>
