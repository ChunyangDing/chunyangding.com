<center> <h1> July 12 -- Acts 12 </h1> </center>

<p> Hi all! </p>

<p> Finally writing the next email :D Very nice to see pictures from Jakarta and with Tuan :) This Sunday, I will be going back to New Haven to work with the research group that I have been working with this past two years. Unfortunately though, my OPT hasn't been approved yet so I have been trying to figure out how to go about it! Otherwise, I have been tending to some medical stuff and forms for grad school that I, of course, left to just before I left. At the same time, I wanted to prioritize time with my family and sister before I left and hence the delay! Thank you all for being kind and patient! </p>

<p> Acts 12 starts with the death of James and the imprisonment of Peter, but it has affected me first with the narration of Peter's rescue. Visually imagining the story as if reading a novel, it actually is quite a magical rescue. Although Peter is not fully awake at the time of the rescue, he is confident of what has happened. It says "And he went our and followed him. He did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision" (Acts 12:9) My impression is that he felt like in a dream. I think he did have some consciousness and chose to obey the angel's commands, even if in the dream. Why is it the case that Peter being rescued in a state of half-sleep and is not fully awoken? It is a bit of a stretch, but I wonder if it has something to do with seeing how he responds with his heart (similarly to the event at the end of the chapter!). I feel like in my dreams, I still can't/don't do a thing that I don't feel is right. When I wake up, most of the time I'm surprised that I had acted as I think I should even though it's a dream. A dream recently that I had recently was a bit different. I don't remember it well, but what I do remember is that I think how I was behaving was a bit off/wrong for the brief time that I remembered my dream when I woke up. Even though I consciously thought that it's wrong, I think there must be an inclination of my heart towards that and in my dream it could surface more easily. All this is to say that maybe the obedience of Peter in his dreamlike state, showed that his heart willingly obeys the Lord. </p>

<p> The end of the chapter describes the death of Herod. He is giving an oration and is praised by the crowd that said "...The voice of a god, and not of a man!" (Acts 12:22). Herod's reaction to this is not described, but we are told that he is immediately struck down by an angel of God because "...he did not give God the glory" (Acts 12:23) as opposed to Peter's rejection of worship in Acts 10 as the study bible notes. The immediacy of the consequence might reflect that it was not due to a particular action that Herod did after he was praised, but by how his heart responded to the praise. </p>

<p> Although it is challenging (and maybe because it is challenging), I find it really valuable that the Gospel concerns the heart and not actions (though actions can reflect the heart). I hope that I can be diligent in tending to my heart as guided by God. </p>

<p> Tonight I watched Narnia with my parents and learned that my sister had also watched it with them twice and really likes the movie, which made me very happy! I remember seeing Narnia with my mom as a kid and when she bought me a book in the series that was the first time that I really enjoyed to read. I remember that after I finished the series, I cried because I thought I would never read something as beautiful again. I had no idea that Aslan represented Jesus at the time, nor did I know the story of Jesus. It's a thought I had now that maybe my heart was inclined towards the truth of God and, in terms of the essence of the story, it was true that it is the most beautiful thing I could read. It has perplexed me for a long time that the lion's name was Aslan, which means Lion in Turkish. I looked it up after seeing the movie and C. S. Lewis did intentionally use the Turkish word for it. The name of the witch also is read about as similar as could be to the word 'CadÄ±', meaning witch in Turkish. I remember I was also happy as a child to see that Edmund liked Turkish delights! I still don't know why C. S. Lewis had so many references to Turkish, but I feel like it's meaningful for me and perhaps it is for others too. </p>
