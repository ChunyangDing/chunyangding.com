<center> <h1> July 28 -- Acts 15 </h1> </center>

<p> Hi yall! Sorry for being super duper extra late on this one :( I promise I'll be more punctual going forward. </p>

<p> Chapter 15 focuses on the Jerusalem council, an important gathering among the apostles, elders, Paul + Barnabas, & the "circumcision party" (as referred to in chpt 11).  </p>

<p> The council was organized because some people in the circumcision party from Judea (where Jerusalem is) went to outlying churches teaching that "It is necessary to circumcise them and to order them to keep the law of Moses" [15:5], 'them' being new Gentile Christians, and 'necessary' meaning necessary for Gentiles' inclusion into Christianity/the church. Paul and Barnabas strongly disagree with this, and so the council is called. </p>

<p> After extended discussion, the church ends up deciding that Gentile believers should take on "no greater burden than these, that you abstain from what has been sacrificed, to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality" [15:28-29]. The church's decision also means Gentile believers don't have to be circumcised, since circumcision is not listed in the list of prohibitions. </p>

<p> Some observations & questions: </p>
<p> a) Why did the church decide on what they did? Re: not making circumcision mandatory, I personally found the clearest explanation in Paul's testimony. "And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them [Gentiles], by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us, and he made no distinction between us and them, having cleansed their hearts by faith... we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will" [15:8-11].  </p>

<p> I think what Paul is saying is that since  </p>
<p> i) accepting Christ + receiving the Holy Spirit is sufficient to become a Christian/receive salvation from God, and  </p>
<p> ii) he has witness Gentiles experiencing a), then </p>
<p> iii) saying that these same Gentiles still need to be circumcised to become "real" Christians/receive salvation is false teaching </p>

<p> Do you guys have any thoughts on this? :) I've reread the chapter several times and am still not 100% sure I nailed down Paul's reasoning. </p>

<p> b) When the church ends up coming to agreement, it does so with unity and decisiveness. When they choose Paul and Barnabas to inform Gentile believers outside Jerusalem of the council's decision, they do so together. "Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch" [15:22]. Moreover, the church also stresses that their decision is not solely a product of human thought, but was produced with God's guidance. "For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us..." [15:28]. I think the church's process of decision-making in this particular case highlights Eric's point last time about the importance of "receiv[ing] good teaching in the midst of false teachers..." </p>

<p> c) Where does chapter 15 leave us re: the importance of circumcision? It certainly seems as if being/not being circumcised is treated more of a ceremonial (i.e non-moral) issue rather than a moral one. But if so, why was it so important in the OT and to Jewish Christians in chpt 15 including James, who despite being a main figure in the council's decision not to mandate circumcision was himself circumcised/would have voluntarily chosen to be? (ESV Bible Study notes "James was noted for his scrupulous keeping of Jewish law"). </p> 

<p> d) Interestingly, I think the church's decision also weaves in some "just because we can do something (e.g not being circumcised for Gentile believers) doesn't mean we should do it" type thinking. The ESV Study Bible notes points out that unlike being free of sexual immorality, which is prohibited because it is objectively sinful, the prohibitions surrounding food are "contextually sensitive" and designed so "Gentile Christians could have fellowship with Jewish Christians and avoid giving unnecessary offense". The notes also reference 1 Corinthians 8, where (I believe) Paul says that it is okay in a vacuum for a believer to eat meat offered to idols because they can do so without acknowledging the existence of idols, but that in practice doing so will tempt new or uncertain believers into eating food offered to idols in an idolatrous manner, and so believers should just not eat food offered to idols. </p>

<p> It seems like Paul implies that in a vacuum eating food offered to idols is a non-moral issue - you can do it or not do it and it has no standing on your spiritual maturity/holiness. But if that is so, why is James ok w/ making a group of Christians (Gentiles) refrain from one non-moral issue (eating food offered to idols) because it is so offensive to an ethnic group within the church (Jewish Christians) that it would harm fellowship, but not ok w/ making that same group (Gentiles) refrain from another non-moral issue (circumcision) for the very same goal (unity & fellowship)? I'd love to hear you guys if you have any thoughts on this. </p>

<p> Hope you guys are doing well? :D Also, Tuna, I googled around for why there are so many Turkish references in Narnia hahaha and I found some pretty interesting links :p Unfortunately they're not super conclusive, but I thought you might find it interesting.  </p>
