<center> <h1> December 7 -- Acts 26 </h1> </center>

<p> Hi everyone! Hope you've all had a good week. I went to a Christmas celebration today with the undergraduate Princeton Christian Fellowship. It was nice to be in a big group like TNT again. The format is different, but it did remind me of the old days :) I will jump right into chapter 26! </p>

<p> Acts 26: </p>
<p> The chapter gives Paul's defense before King Agrippa, who was introduced to Paul's case in the previous chapter by Festus. It appears that although Festus accepted that Paul should be tried by Caesar, he did not understand what the charges were against him and sought the counsel of King Agrippa, who was familiar with Jewish customs. </p>

<p> One element of interest is that we see how Paul tailors this speech to his audience, King Agrippa. He starts first by noting how fortunate he is to appear before him given his familiarity with Jewish customs and controversies (26:3). He establishes first that he has lived as a Pharisee in his youth, knowing that Agrippa understand what this means in terms of his devotion to Jewish customs. He goes on to tell that he was on the side who persecuted followers of Jesus until the Lord called to him to stop persecuting him and do his work. Perhaps the force of the change in his direction from persecuting Christians to spreading the Gospel lends credibility to Paul's testimony that God has called on him. </p>

<p> Over the course of his testimony Paul is interrupted by Festus, who tells Paul that he is out of his mind, to which Paul responds very politely and instead uses the statement made against him to invite King Agrippa into conversation with him to ask about what he thinks of all that has been happening. Even though Paul is making a very important defense he sees it as an opportunity for the gospel to reach the ears of more people, in this case King Agrippa and all who are in the court. </p>

<p> It was also interesting to hear Agrippa's judgment at the end that Paul could have been set free then if he had not appealed to Caesar. This judgement by the knowledgable source tells us that there was clearly no wrongdoing done by Paul. I wonder if it also suggests that although Paul's release could have been more easily attained, his trial in Rome would lead to sharing the gospel in more circles. </p>

<p> Those were some thoughts on the chapter, have a great weekend all! </p>

<p> best, </p>
