<p> Chunny, thanks for the email :) I hope the new church has been a good fit for your parents, and I hope that they will be able to find good community and teaching there! I hope that you're settled back into the east coast, and that work is going well. John, I hope moving into the bay has been fairly smooth, and Tuna, I hope research is going well! Re: updates for me, I just had my white coat ceremony this past Friday, and it was a great time to hang out with my family and some friends in the area. I've attached some pics. classes are picking up now, and we've been doing a lot of biostats and coding -- a funny, non-medical introduction to medical school for sure. </p>

<p> Acts 18:  </p>
<p> v3. he was hard at work, as a tentmaker most of the week. Still, he was so effective in his ministry! </p>
<p> v4. Paul is opposed even after he diligently shares; he goes to preach to the Gentiles </p>
<p> v.9 in the past, he was discerning when to go and when to stay, but here was guided to stay and preach in the face of opposition because he has the assurance of the holy spirit. And he was protected from harm -- this was especially important because it came before the Jews began to accuse him. In the face of this opposition, he didn't even have to defend himself and his innocence was established  </p>
<p> v.10 God knows who his people are.  </p>
<p> v. 21 Paul's departing statement, "I will return to you if God wills" is so meaningful precisely because he does what God wills!  </p>
<p> Apollos -- cool dude, deep knowledge of the scriptures, and a passion to share it with others. I'm sure there's a lot more there w.r.t. the church, but I found it to be a pretty inspiring and bold example.  </p>

<p> I look forward to catching up on Sat :) </p>
