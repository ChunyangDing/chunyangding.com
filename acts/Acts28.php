<center> <h1> February 15 -- Acts 28 </h1> </center>

<p> Hey friends, here we are at the end of Acts -- a journey that has taken us from June 2019 to February 2020! not bad :)  </p>

<p> I hope y'all are doing well in this new year in your respective cities... it's been a busy start to the year for me. I finished a short winter term with five classes, and now I'm in the spring term where we cover the physiology of major organ systems (cardio, resp, renal, endocrine, etc...) I'm also taking a deep learning course for healthcare, since I've joined a computational lab for my thesis. My project will focus on using ML and causal inference with neonatal ICU chest x-rays to predict cardiopulmonary events in prematurely born infants. I'm also working on another project that will use corneal scans to predict different ophthalmologic diseases! pretty excited to get back into researchand to learn more about ML </p>

<p> In other news, I went back to Yale last weekend and saw Chris Kim (and Tomi) get baptized, it's was a really special time to see his confession of faith as evidence of the constant growth that we experience as followers of Christ.  </p>

<p> This comes as encouragement in a period of time that has been spiritually challenging. In part because I let it, med school's been time consuming in a way that pervades most of my disposable time through the week. I don't have the benefit of a small group/weekly large group to punctuate my week encouragement from scripture and from Christian community, and so it's been a period of adjustment for sure. I'm hoping to get plugged in with my Church's small group as soon as possible, and to join a men's group that's just getting off the ground. Prayers for steadfastness, for eagerness to learn about God, and for freedom from temptations would be greatly appreciated. On the flipside, there have been some real pearls in Christian community -- the Christian Med/dental fellowship has been really nice, and I've just started to do Friday morning devotional/prayer time with a brother here. I hope that this will eventually expand and encourage many others; for now, I'm hoping for consistency and a willing heart.  </p>

<p> There's a lot more going on, i'm sure, in each of our lives so I'll stop my updates here. We should call to catch up sometime soon! </p>

<p> Alright, onto Acts 28, which is starts off on the shores of Malta. For visual reference, here's matla (look up some more photos, it's stunning): </p>

<p> So far, Acts has been all about living in the power of the Holy Spirit. Paul and the apostles are out doing great work, Paul is imprisoned, and he goes through a series of appeals, and now he's shipwrecked on this island.  </p>

<p> I really appreciate Chunny's point about God's mercy even through the worst of storms, and how we have the tendency to dispose of God's mercy once we're through the worst part of the storm. Paul, however, is aware of both God's mercy and the power of the holy spirit, and so he is a powerful witness to God everywhere he goes:  </p>
<p> In Malta:  </p>

<p> Paul is attacked by the Viper, but isn't killed. if nothing else, Paul's a lucky guy. But more likely, it's evidence that's God's protective hand is what allows Paul to continue in his ministry. So far, Gods' protected him from other people, from the forces of nature, and from animals! </p>
<p> Paul heals the father of Publius, and the rest of the island's sick. In return, they get enough provisions to complete the voyage. God provides, sometimes through our small acts of faithfulness </p>

<p> In Rome/Puteoli: </p>

<p> there are believers here that Paul's able to stay with! the gospel continues to spread.  </p>
<p> paul can stay by himself with a soldier to guard him... </p>

<p> Under Roman Guard:  </p>

<p> people are curious about his "sect" because it's widely spoken against.  </p>
<p> People come to his house day after day to learn about the gospel, and this statement rubbed people the wrong way: <br>
    26 “‘Go to this people and say,<br>
    “You will be ever hearing but never understanding;<br>
        you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.”<br>
    27 For this people’s heart has become calloused;<br>
        they hardly hear with their ears,<br>
        and they have closed their eyes.<br>
    Otherwise they might see with their eyes,<br>
        hear with their ears,<br>
        understand with their hearts<br>
    and turn, and I would heal them.’[a]<br> </p>

<p> for two years, he lived there at his own expense, and was able to witness to people about Christ, and to write many letters. I feel like there's a lot there in his example, where he continues to spend and pour out even though he's in chains, for the purpose of reaching more people. That's not an attitude that would come easily to me. When I feel constrained by others, I cut back on things in self preservation. But Paul's living by the guidance of the holy spirit! </p>

<p> Anyhow, that's it for Acts. it's been so good :)  </p>

<p> Best, </p>
<p> Eric </p>
