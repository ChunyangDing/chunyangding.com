<center> <h1> July 2 -- Acts 8 </h1> </center>
<p> Hey all! </p> 
 
<p>That's a cool discovery John :D and hope you have a good time with Tuan! I might keep this short because I just got back home from the trip. </p> 

<p>Chapter 8 starts by introducing Saul and his deeds around the time Stephen was stoned. Fitting with the sovereignty of God, perhaps even though these early actions of Saul caused suffering to believers, it might have also lead to the scattering and spreading of the believers' faith in the early years of Christianity. This brought to mind John's question about church's sins. Although I can't see the good in it, at an abstract level I believe that God is sovereign over all creation and that creation is heading towards restoration. At the same time, I think the church is still responsible for the sin and we should know to repent. </p> 

<p>The chapter also describes Philip's ministry in Samaria where he also meets Simon the magician. The first time I read this chapter, I was a bit confused about the character of Simon, but I think it makes a bit more sense now. He is a person that amazes those around him, but then becomes amazed by the miracles performed while Philip is there and is said to believe. When he saw the coming down of the Holy Spirit by Peter's hand, he might have thought that he found a way to be great again. Rather than wanting the Holy Spirit to be near him, he desires control over it as a means to greatness. I don't think it's necessarily bad to be drawn to worship God because one is amazed by miracles performed in His name, but maybe in Simon's case he ultimately seeks to bring back to himself the power to amaze. </p> 

<p>It is a bit unclear how genuine Simon's faith was, but it does say that he believed. That was a moment that exposed the weakness of his heart, but I wonder again if he did have some faith since he asked Peter to pray for him that none of what he said might happen to him. It might only be a prayer meant to protect himself from harm, but I thought it does recognize the Lord's might. </p> 

<p>It was also nice to read about Philip's ministry of the Ethiopian eunuch guided by the Holy Spirit in each step. Philip acted with obedience in a setting that was guided by God. I thought maybe there are cases like this in our lives that we miss because we don't listen or because we choose to ignore and continue the regular flow of things. This week spending time with my parents and a childhood friend, there were a couple instances that I felt did naturally lead to good conversation and some that didn't happen because I didn't follow it. </p> 

<p>Thank you for the emails all! It's really nice to keep hearing from you on life and thoughts :) </p> 

<p>Best, </p> 

<p>Tuna </p>
