<center> <h1> June 29 -- Acts 5 </h1> </center>

<p> Hey guys! </p>

<p> Thanks for the thoughts/reflections so far! I'll try to keep this one a bit brief - it's been a long week working, but the Word is refreshing and life giving :) </p>

<p> 1) This idea of "reaping what you sow" has been coming up over and over for me recently - the relevant passage is here is 5:4b: "What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied to men but to God." At our church, we are doing a study in Proverbs, and in Proverbs 1:8-19, it discusses about sinners who try to entice a child, saying: "If they say, 'Come along with us; let's lie in wait for someone's blood, let's waylay some harmless soul; let's swallaw them alive, like the grave, and whole, like those who go down to the pit; we will get all sorts of valuable things and fill our houses with plunder." (Proverbs 1:11-13)  while the father (Solomon) says: "These men lie in wait for their own blood; they waylay only themselves! Such is the end of all who go after ill-gotten gain; it takes away the lives of those who get it." (Proverbs 1:18-19). </p>

<p> So to me, the start of Acts 5 just seemed to really pop! It seems to fit directly in line with Solomon's advice - lying for your own gain, to Peter, and immediately falling down dead. I think we usually expect judgment to happen at the end of our earthly existence, but here is an example of it happening right then and there. And even more frightening is that the same things happens to Ananias' wife, Sapphira, who associates with the act, just as Solomon warns his child to not even associate with those who follow that path. </p>

<p> This entire thing just reminds me again and again about the justice of the Lord. When we try to cheat others, we always are cheating ourselves. We are depriving ourselves of the goodness of God's grace, and walking down a path of wickedness instead. </p>

<p> 2) The ability of the apostles to appear before the Sanhedrin and to continue preaching is just astonishing. I mean, so much to unpack. First, the breaking out of the prison... and instead of running to hide, they just stand in front of the courts teaching the people! I have a feeling that if I just got out of a bad situation, my default instinct is to hide away... probably in my bed... for a few days at least. But for Peter and the other apostles, they get right back to it. Again, that boldness that John and Tuna have been pointing out. And then, the teacher Gamaliel's speech... and the ability of God to use people who would be His enemy for His own plan. And then! The Sandhein still hasn't had their pound of flesh, so they still decide to flog the apostles... and then!! "The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worth of suffering disgrace for the Name. Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Christ/Messiah." (Acts 5:41-42) </p>

<p> That is so incredible. Being punished, and still rejoicing that you were punished. During my weekly one-on-ones with my boss, I do ask for her to point out where I am not doing something correctly and where I can improve... but I still feel hurt if she actually points out something that I was screwing up :P Even though I know that she is correcting me, by my own request, I still don't usually rejoice for it. And for feeling correction from God, well, it also doesn't seem pleasant, but I can accept it because God is God. But Peter and the Apostles to accept punishment and persecution by their true enemies, and still come out and rejoice and do even more. </p>

<p> And yeah, both of these fully come from a more solid understanding of the Lord and His moral truths...but that isn't enough either. Paul writes "You who brag about the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law? As it is written: 'God's name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you." (Romans 2:23-24). Knowing what is right and doing what is right is still different in Christ's view. </p>

<p> It's Saturday here in DC right now (whoops sending this out a day late again haha), and it has been a refreshing week. I think I was a bit down in the first part of the week, feeling a bit sick. I was getting into the rhythm of work, but was still scared of doing something wrong. After our all-hands meeting last Friday, all of the senior physicists have been a bit panicked, possibly because our CEO wants us to deliver something that might be slightly impossible... So it was hard to ask for any help at all, because I knew that any time the senior physicists were helping me was taking away their time from working on the more critical components. But asking for help and learning from it is still important for the long run and being productive (as my boss corrected me, haha). Likewise, asking for help, instruction, and wisdom from the Lord is truly crucial to a godly life. </p>

<p> Hope to hear from you all soon! Does next Saturday work for another call? :DD </p>

<p> In Christ, </p>
