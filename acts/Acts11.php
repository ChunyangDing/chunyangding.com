<center> <h1> July 9 -- Acts 11 </h1> </center>

<p> Hi y'all! Hope's everyone doing well! </p>

<p> @Eric Love the pictures! Chunny sent me a postcard of Crater Lake once but it looks even more majestic in real life! Not a fan of the bubblegum wall tho XD </p>

<p> Acts 11 is divided into two parts: a) Peter reports back to the Jerusalem church about his experience w/ Cornelius, and then b) we hear about the Antioch church. </p>

<p> Part a) is interesting in that it's essentially a retelling of Acts 10. Most of the details are repeated again in chapter 11, which (I think) says something about how important the event was to have been essentially retold twice in the pages of Acts. Peter reports how Cornelius and his household received the Holy Spirit despite being Gentiles, and the church responds with a kind of stunned amazement. "When they heard these things they fell silent. And they glorified God, saying 'Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance that leads to life'" [11:18] What a monumental turning point in God's story for humanity! The ESV Study Bible points out that the fact this was "an astounding realization for these Jewish Christians in Jerusalem". Cornelius' story also acts as a wonderful reassurance for all the Gentiles since his time (all 4 of us included!!) who can rejoice that God's grace has been extended beyond the Jewish people and to us as well.  </p>

<p> In some sense, the astonishment of the Jerusalem church perhaps also reflects the reality that the early Jewish believers hadn't yet fully understood the full scope of God's redemptive plan for everyone on earth. Reading chapter 11 reminded me of 3 instances in Jesus' ministry that foreshadows Cornelius' household receiving the Holy Spirit and salvation. </p>

<p> a) In the Parable of the Great Banquet, the master in the parable commands his servant to "Go out to the highways and hedges and compel people to come in, that my house may be filled" [Luke 14:23]. The ESV Bible Study comments that "The highways and hedges, outside the city, represent Gentiles".  </p>

<p> b) In John 4, Jesus ministers to the Samaritan woman at the well and reveals to her that he is the Messiah (to her great joy). "The woman said to him, 'I know that Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ). When he comes, he will tell us all things.' Jesus said to her, 'I who speak to you am he'" [John 4:25-26]. This is despite the contextual note for readers in the early part of chapter 4's note "...(For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)" [John 4:9] </p>

<p> c) The Great Commission at the end of Matthew quotes Jesus as commanding the disciples to "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" [Matthew 28:9]. Jesus tells them to baptize disciples of all nations in the name of Holy Spirit! </p>

<p> In addition to these 3 examples, we've already seen Philip preaching Christ in Samaria and to the Ethiopian eunuch (Acts 8). I think chapter 11 has something powerful to say about how deep ethnic roots can sometimes blind us to God's heart for all people, but also that the Gospel has the power to break all of that and be a force for Biblical reconciliation. </p>

<p> What is the church's response to the revelation about Gentiles? Well, from the rest of Acts 11 at least the church's spiritual growth progresses in fits and starts. On one hand, we see believers preaching to more Gentiles "But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Hellenists also, preaching the Lord Jesus. And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord." [11:20-21] Reminds me of what Sang told us once about how our journeys to Christ are made possible by the many small steps of faith and obedience believers who came before us in the past chose to take. On the other hand, we see that the mention of the circumcision party who criticized Peter because "You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them" [11:3] is itself a foreshadowing of larger debate about how Gentiles ought to live as new Christians that blows up in Acts 15. </p>

<p> In other life news, I'm at a CS conference in Jakarta w/ Tuan. We also toured around the city a little bit - attached photos of us at the National Monument, the old city, and the Jakarta History Museum! </p>

<p> Cheers, </p>
