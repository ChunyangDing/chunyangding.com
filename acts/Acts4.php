		<p> Hello everyone! </p> 

		<p> Thank you for the reflections John! I like the title of your book recommendation and also think that I should read/think more about work &amp; professions for a more concrete picture of how one can always keep God close to heart. I might let you know if I'd like to read the book later :) </p> 

		<p> Today we visited the House of Mary and the ancient town of Ephesus with my parents! Both visits were pretty interesting and we got to talk about Paul's time in Ephesus in Acts and it was nice to be able to refer to the study bible for some historical context on the city before visiting :D </p> 
		<p> (There was information on the House of Mary, on the site that I'm attaching in case anyone is interested. It is a place that was visited by popes from Vatican in the past century. The attachment cites some evidence from the Scripture that sounds reasonable to me, but I was curious if any of you had heard about the place before.) </p> 

		<p> 1) I think the boldness of the apostles is also a key theme in this chapter. I feel like their boldness is supported by absolute certainty on truth and morality.  </p> 
		<p> -But Peter and John answered them, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge, 20 for we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard.” Acts 4:19-20 (ESV) </p> 
		<p> I do think you need to be both certain of truth and of morality in order to have good reason to act boldly. If one lacks facts of the matter, a strong decision of consequences would be difficult to make. Likewise, even knowing the facts, if one does not know morally what action is good and bad, a strong decision cannot be made. I think the lines above reflect these two qualities of the apostles: being certain in the truth and being certain in what is right and wrong. Here they ask their listeners to reflect on two simple moral principles: 1) it is good to obey God 2) it is good to speak the truth -> given that the truth that they know with certainty is the resurrection of Jesus and God wills people to be saved in the name of Jesus it follows that they they must continue speaking. There is no doubt what the right course of action is since they are certain both on truth and morality. </p> 

		<p> 2) I think in life this is rarely the case! It can be so hard and painful to make decisions. As long as we live, we are bound to make decisions but I often find myself lacking in both knowing the facts and knowing what's right. This chapter suggests that we can pray for boldness so that we may act boldly. The prayer (Acts 4:23-31) includes praise of the sovereignty of God over creation's past and future, recognition of the difficulties of threats and asking for boldness. </p> 
		<p> I think the difficulty that this prayer identifies with bold action is that there can be difficult consequences that we want to stay away from, following threats by the Sadducees. A few sentences ago, I said that I often lack the knowledge of truth or morality. I think that's true, but sometimes I simply don't act in a way that I think I should because I shy away. I think this attitude in turn inhibits my knowing the truth and morality of the matter with certainty because I keep away from the matter. </p> 

		<p> Although this prayer recognizes the difficulty of threats, I think an action to take towards boldness for any case can be to reflect on the causes, know the sovereignty of God and pray for boldness. </p> 

		<p> For John's question of why we don't act as boldly today, I see three possible reasons after this chapter: 1) not knowing facts/truth well 2) not knowing right&wrong well 3) being deterred as a mortal being. Judging from myself, 3) supporting 1) &amp; 2) could be a common reason! I think I'm not getting to the root of the matter with how today is different from then, but this could be something to discuss together if people are interested! </p> 

		<p> Best, </p>

		<p> PS - It was pretty cool to be in somewhere in the NT! You guys should come to Turkey if you ever get the chance :D </p>
