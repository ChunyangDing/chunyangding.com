<center> <h1> September 29 -- Acts 22 </h1> </center>

<p> Hello all, and happy Sunday! </p>

<p> I was at the postal museum yesterday - they have several remarkably well-made exhibits, although the irony of a booth for "Sign up for our email list!" was not lost on me - and they were giving away free post cards! Do check your mailboxes maybe next week? :)) </p>

<p> I definitely feel like things have gotten busier over the past few weeks - it feels like tensions are much more elevated as our startup races to meet an external deadline in December. I am definitely very thankful for being able to experience this unique situation without actually having the bulk of the stress on myself (yay for being too incompetent to actually contribute to the primary project? ðŸ˜‚), but trying to make myself more useful while also not becoming anxious about things! God has been good - whenever I feel like I am straying away, I find myself brought back to Him, through the community group that I am part of, or through my (slightly more regular?) morning quiet times. Reread The Screwtape Letters and read Madeleine L'Engle's And It Was Good over the past few weeks, and definitely felt myself brought back to a better base level than before. </p>

<p> Acts 22 seems to me like one of the best ways that we are called to use our own privilege to serve the Lord. Paul is so incredibly bold here - even as he is being arrested, he speaks to the crowd in Aramaic, and tells his testimony. And he does this with no expectation of things going well - in fact, he is there to call out the sin of those in Jerusalem. Although he has this earthly privilege of being a natural-born Roman citizen, he values his Christian citizenship as infinitely more valuable, and is willing to sacrifice that worldly privilege for that which is more important. This is especially prevalent in versus 25-29, where it seems to me that he doesn't claim Roman citizenship just to get out of a flogging, but so that he could travel to Rome to spread the gospel even further. </p>

<p> All of this makes me think even more about the unique position/privilege/identity that I have, from being a Yale alum, to being a physicist/scientist, to being an immigrant from China. I sometimes still feel awkward about being from Yale - especially in a town centered around a state college, and in a company where the vast majority of employees are graduates of UMD or UC-Boulder. I guess I dont want to feel judged for being from an "elite" school, and want to feel more as someone who would fit in? But the Bible does not tell us to fit in with the world, but instead, to "not conform to the pattern of the world". (Romans 12:2). </p>

<p> Recently, the coworker who I have been working closest with, David, was chatting with me about eyes. I had just come back from a eye exam, and somehow my eyesight improved? (Lesson learned - stare directly into high-powered UV lasers to imrpove your vision :D ) When I shared this story with him, he remarked about something similar that had happened with his mother back in Peru. His mother was very religious, and fairly suddenly, it seemed like she was no longer far-sighted. Being quite Catholic, David's mother attributed this to a miracle by one of the Catholic saints, and was incredibly overjoyed. However, David, as a physicist/optics specialist, was very doubtful and suspicious. He reasoned that the only thing that could really create a sudden change in vision is if the index of refraction of your eyes changes to sharpen the focus of the light rays - in other words, the beginning of catact formation in the eyes. He implored his mom to get an eye exam, and sure enough, there were signs of cataracts developing. </p>

<p> Besides being a fun story, I'm not entirely sure how to respond, as both a physicist and as a Christian. On one hand, I find that David was very clever to have helped his mother catch this eye disease so early on! Yet on the other hand, I know that David is not religious. I don't want to attempt to rebuke him, but I'm also not really sure how to have a dialogue without it harming our work relationship. I feel like I am open about being a Christian at the company (ie, when people ask what I do on the weekends/nights, I do bring up going to church/community groups), yet there is a lot of hesitancy when other coworkers are more flippant towards religion than I am. </p>

<p> How are you guys facing/dealing/thinking about that issue? In The Screwtape Letters, one of the letters from Screwtape advises Wormwood to help make this human feel comfortable with the contradiction - to breed in the human the feeling of self-superiority to their different groups of friends, as being morally superior to his secular friends and being more worldly than his religious friends. But I'm still not sure how to bridge that kind of gap in a Godly way today! </p>

<p> Whoooops, sorry for the long email. Hoping to hear from you all in the near future :) </p>
