<p> Hello all! </p>

<p> Ahhhhhh, many apologies for the late message! It's good to hear from you all - congrats on the OPT, Tuna, and Eric, have you settled in to Boston yet? I've been back home in Seattle since Wednesday evening for my dad's 50th birthday... it's been a really lovely time back in the Pacific Northwest for a few days! It's been a whirlwind back home - from (successfully!) crabbing, watching the Blue Angels at Seafair, visiting Vancouver (and running over a tire in the middle of the interstate... big oof...)... but one of the best things that has happened is that I took my parents to a new church! I'm not sure how much of this have I talked about in the past, but over the last few years, I've been pretty worried about their ability to find community in the church. Our home church has had great programming, but I often feel that programs and events is not a good replacement for genuine warmth and care! I searched for a ton of churches while I was home, and took them to a new one this Sunday in the hopes that it would work well... and it immediately felt like home when we came in. It was very much like the church that our family went to in Knoxville - small, supportive, and full of love. I'm really praying that this will help anchor them for this upcoming period of time! </p>

<p> Re: John's message on Acts 15: Our church actually preached on this passage while talking about Proverbs and the ways to receive wisdom! Especially in the way that this disagreement was calmly discussed, with deliberation and listening to others as they spoke. The unity of the decision, and the follow up with the letter as well as the sending of Paul and Barnabas to affirm that message as well. Regarding circumcision: my perspective is that circumcision inherently is very positive - as Tuna mentions - but that it was transformed into a stumbling block over time. I think the Jews were using the mark of circumcision to exclude gentiles, just as the Pharisees accused Jesus of eating with sinners and working on the Sabbath. For those actions, Jesus told the Pharisees that their adherence to the law was preventing them from opening their hearts to Christ. So it isn't so much an "offending" issue, as an issue that would prevent those people from more fully Christ's message. </p>

<p> (we've gotta figure out a better system to respond to these questions/messages instead of in our semi-regular emails lol) </p>

<p> Re: Eric/Tuna on the Spirit - I'm reading through Francis Chan's Forgotten God: Reversing our Tragic Neglect of the Holy Spirit right now and was just doing a study on Romans 7 the other day, about being dead to sin and a slave to righteousness. I think Jiaying brought up a really great point during our call about figuring out the connection between intent and practice, and in particular, understanding how to adhere to the very strict standards that are set out for us! I think that this has to be done through the Holy Spirit, through continuous prayer with God, and through the local body of church. In other words, it is far too easy to stumble away from His truth by ourselves, but when we are brought together in fellowship (like through these emails that have just been getting longer and longer!!!), we are able to be corrected. </p>

<p> And finally, re: Tuna on the possessed woman: it seemed really similar to a passage in Mark 1:21-28, on how Jesus exorcised a demon possessing a woman. It doesn't bring me a lot of clarity as to why the demon is compelled to do this, but at least there is precedent? </p>

<p> Alright! Acts 17! </p>

<p> We see three locations visited here: Thessalonica, Berea, and Athens. It's really cool to see Paul's interaction in Thessalonica, especially with his two letters to the church here. It really strikes me the way that he writes those letters even after being run out the city by a mob - that just seems absolutely wild to me. The start of 1 Thessalonians is just so filled with love and thanksgiving that it's hard to imagine that they witnessed that the people "dragged Jason and some other believers before the city officials, shouting : 'These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here.' " (Acts 17:6). What kind of amazing love and patience is needed to write in this style! </p>

<p> The visit to Athens again seems to show how Paul can adapt the primary message of the gospel depending on his audience. He understands what kinds of people are in Athens, and is able to reach them with a message that might not work the same way in Lystra, for example. I think sometimes it is easy to get stuck in the zone where we can only preach what reaches us, instead of considering what is most effective for the person we are speaking with to understand the Gospel. </p>

<p> Ahhhhh I'm gonna cut it short here to board a super crappy flight to Baltimore! See you all soon! </p>
