				<h1>Server Design</h1>
				<p> Part of what I had wanted to accomplish in designing this website was learning how to use my own server for hosting. I have serious reservations about using large, complex software-as-a-service subscriptions for hosting things that would hopefully live semi-permanently, and it didn't seem like too much of a challenge to learn the basics. I followed several web tutorials to set up a pure Linux box, which is what is currently serving you this page! While setting things up, I kept a careful record of all of the commands I sent the server, so that I could fix an mistakes as needed. So far, things look okay, so I'm going to post what I did here, to hopefully act as a simple guide for setting up your own server. </p>
