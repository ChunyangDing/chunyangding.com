C/G					  Am/E
Love of mine, someday you will die
			F							 C			  G
But I'll be close behind and I'll follow you into the dark
   C/G							Am/E
No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
			   F						 C					G
Just our hands clasped so tight, waiting for the hint of a spark

   Am				C				 F			C	G/B
If heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied
Am			   C				G
Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs
    Am				C				  E		Am	Am/G
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
F				Fm			   C/G
Then I'll follow you into the dark

In Catholic school as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me,
Son, fear is the heart of love, so I never went back

You and me we've seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary and the soles of your shoes
Are all worn down

The time for sleep is now
But it's nothing to cry about
'Cause we'll hold each other soon in the blackest of rooms

[Chorus]
