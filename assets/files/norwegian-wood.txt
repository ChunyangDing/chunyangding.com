I once had a girl
			D	C   (0)  G   D
Or should I say she once had me
D			      D(4)
She showed me her room
		 D    C  (0) G  D
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?

    Dm										G   G
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
   Dm											Em	A
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on a rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said
"It's time for bed"

    Dm												 G   G
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
  Dm												Em  A
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?
