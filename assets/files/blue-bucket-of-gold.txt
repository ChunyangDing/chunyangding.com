Blue Bucket of Gold
by Sufjan Stevens

Slow, steady downstrokes, simulating piano chords

D Em G D G F#m A

D       Em         G     D
My blue bucket of gold
G                     F#m   A
Friend, why donâ€™t you love me?
D        Em			    G     D
Once the myth has been told
G						 F#m	A
The lens deforms it as lightning

[Hook]
G					  Em	A
	Raise your right hand
A			D		A		G
Tell me you want me in your life
G				    Em		A
Or raise your red flag
A			 D		 A		G
Just when I want you in my life

G Bm F#m A x2, G

D       	Em         G     D
Search for things to extol
G                     F#m    A
Friend, the fables delight me
D        Em		   G         D
My blue bucket of gold
G					   F#m	 A
Lord, touch me with lightning

(Hook)
