Put Your Records On
by Corinne Bailey Rae

Capo 2nd - start singing low

DD X D X strumming, heavily syncopated: 1 ee and(slap) 2 and(slap) etc 

G				   A7
Three little birds sat on my window
C/D								 G
And they told me I don't need to worry
G					 A7
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
C/D								      G
Little girls, double-dutch on the concrete

Em7       B7/D#	   Em7							A9
Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's all right
	Cmaj7								  Cmmaj7
The more things seems to change, the more they stay the same
Ooo, don't you hesitate

[Chorus]

G						   A7/E
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
C/D						G
You go ahead, let your hair down

Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
Cmaj7					   Cmmaj7		   G
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in the bar by the road side
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Gotta love that Afro hairdo
Maybe sometimes we feel afraid, but it's all right
The more you stay the same, the more they seem to change
Don't you think it's strange?

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

Am7							 Am7
Twas more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
Em						   (slap)						Am7
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
Am7							Am7					   Cmaj7	Am7
When you gonna realize that you don't even have to try any longer?
Cmaj7 
Do what you want to

[Chorus x2]
