Fmaj7 Em Fmaj7 Em x2

[Pre-Verse]
C						 Em
Ground control to Major Tom
Ground control to Major Tom
Am						  D7/F#
Lock your Soyuz hatch and put your helmet on!

Ground control to Major Tom
Commencing countdown, engines on
Detach from station and may God's love be with you

[Verse 1]
C							    E
This is ground control to Major Tom
						  F
You've really made the grade
		Fm			   C					  F
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
But it's time to guide the capsule if you dare

This is Major Tom to ground control
I've left for ever more
		 Fm			  C				F
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

[Chorus]

	Fmaj7		Em				   Fmaj7		 Em
For here am I sitting in a tin can far above the world
Bb				Am				 G
Planet Earth is blue and there's nothing left to do

[Instrumental]
D UD  D D | D D
C     F G | A A (x2) slide in F pos from 1(F) 3(G) 5(A)
Fmaj7 Em | A C | D E

[Verse 2]
Though I've flown one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much she knows

[Bridge]
G				  E7
Ground control to Major Tom
    Am					  C/G
The time is near, there's not too long
	    D7/F# (C) (G) 
Can you hear me, Major Tom? x3 Can you...

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]
