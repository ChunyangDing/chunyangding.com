First Day of My Life
by Bright Eyes
Capo 4

C E7 Am   F G C x2

C			 E7				Am
This is the first day of my life
F			  G				   C
Swear I was born right in the doorway
C				   E7			 Am
I went out in the rain, suddenly everything changed
		D7				    		G	 G7 (320004 -> 320001)
They're spreading blankets on the beach

Yours was the first face that I saw
I think I was blind before I met you
And I don't know where I am, I don't know where I've been
But I know where I want to go

			 C			G		Am		(double strums)
And so I'd thought I'd let you know
		       F			G			 C  E		Am
Yeah, these things take forever, I especially am slow
		Dmadd9
But I realized that need you And I wondered if I could come home

C E7 Am7 	Dmadd9	Fm

C E7 Am || F G C || C E7 Am || D7 G G7

Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning?
And I thought it was strange, you said everything changed
You felt as if you just woke up
(And you said,) (during G7)
"This is the first day of my life
I'm glad I didn't die before I met you
But now I don't care, (I could go any)where with you
And I'd probably be happy"

			C	G		Am
So if you wanna be with me
	  F						  G
With these things there's no telling
		C		 E		 Am
We just have to wait and see
		  Dmadd9
But I'd rather be working for a paycheck
Than waiting to win the lottery (C E7 Am7)
				Dmadd9
Besides, maybe this time is different
								C
I mean, I really think you like me
