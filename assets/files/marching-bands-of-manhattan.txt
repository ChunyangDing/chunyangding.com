Marching Bands of Manhattan
by DCFC

Rhythm: 4/4, emphasis on down of 1, most lines begin on the up of 1
Heavy syncopation

C					G
If I could open my arms
Dm							Am
And span the length of the isle of Manhattan
C						   G
I'd bring it to where you are
Dm							Am
Making a lake of the East River and Hudson

C					G		(pause)
If I could open my mouth
Dm							Am
Wide enough for a marching band to march out
C					G
They will make your name sing
Dm							Am
And bend through allies and bounce off all the buildings

C / Am / C / G x2

C						   G
I wish we could open our eyes
  Dm				Am					(one breath, continue!)
  To see in all directions at the same time
C					G
Oh what a beautiful view
Dm					Am
If you were never aware - what was around you

C						G
And it is true what you said
Dm					 Am				(one breath, continue!)
That I (live like) a hermit in my own head
C						G
But when the sun shines again
Dm							Am
I'll pull the curtains and blinds to let the light in

F						Am
Sorrow drips into your heart through a pin hole
C							G	
Just like a faucet that leaks and there is comfort in the sound
F						Am
But while you debate half empty and half full
C			G
It slowly rises, your love is gonna drown
