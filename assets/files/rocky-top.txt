Rocky Top

G				C	   G
Wish that I was on ol' Rocky Top
Em			D		  G
Down in the Tennessee hills
G				C		 G
Ain't no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top
Em		 D		   G
Ain't no telephone bills

G			 C		 G
Once I had a girl on Rocky Top
Em		   D		  G
Half bear, other half cat
G					C		 G
Wild as a mink, but sweet as soda pop
Em		D			G
I still dream about that

[Chorus]
Em				  D
Rocky Top, you'll always be
F				   C
Home sweet home to me
C		 G
Good ol' Rocky Top
G		   F      C   G			 F		G
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee

Once two strangers climbed ol' Rocky Top
Lookin' for a moonshine still
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top
Reckon they never will

Corn won't grow at all on Rocky Top
Dirt's too rocky by far
That's why all the folks on Rocky Top
Get their corn from a jar

[Chorus]
