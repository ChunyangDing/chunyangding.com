[Chorus]
					   F					   C
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
			  G						  Am
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
			  F							 C		G
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
G
And you let her go

Am F G Em
Am F G

Am							  F
Staring at the bottom of your glass
	   G						   Em
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
				  Am			  F		 	G
But dreams come slow and they go so fast

You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

[Chorus]

Am							   F
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
		 G					   Em
Same old empty feeling in your heart
				    Am				F		G
'cause love comes slow but it grows apart

Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dive too deep

[Chorus]
				Am
And you let her go
	F	G
Oh oh oh ooooo
x2
				Am		F 	G Em Am F G
And you let her go
