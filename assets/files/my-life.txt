My Life
Billy Joel

D											G
Got a call from an old friend we used to be real close
A									D
Said he couldn't go on the American way
D													  G
Closed the shop, sold a house, bought a ticket to the west coast
A										  D
Now he gives them a stand-up routine in L.A.

Chorus:

D											 G
I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright
A											  D
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
D										  G
I don't care what you say anymore this is my life
A									 Bm
Go ahead with your own life leave me alone

								   F#7
I never said you had to offer me a second chance
D7										E
(pause) I never said I was a victim of circumstance
G		   D	F#7			   Bm
I still belong, Don't get me wrong
E7							G   A  G  A
You can speak your mind but not on my time

D											   G
They will tell you you can't sleep alone in a strange place
A										            D
Then they'll tell you you can't sleep with somebody else
D										  G
Oh, but sooner or later you sleep in your own space
A										   D
Either way it's okay, you wake up with yourself

[Chorus]

I don't care what you say anymore this is my life
Go ahead with your own life leave me alone
