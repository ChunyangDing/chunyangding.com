D D'DU | DUDU D'DU | D D'DU | DUDU D'DU
Verse:
Em7 Gsus7 Dsus4 A7sus4
Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do, about you now

Backbeat, the word was on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

Pre-Chorus:

	Cadd9 			 Dsus4 			  Em7
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
	Cadd9 			    Dsus4 			  Em7
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
		  Cadd9			   Dsus4
There are many things that I would like to 
Gsus7	?  Em7					A7sus4
say     to you but I don't know how

Chorus:
Cadd9 	   Em7 Gsus7 	   Em7 
Because maybe, 		you're gonna be the one that 
saves me, and after 
all, you're my wonderwall
