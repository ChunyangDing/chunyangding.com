I can't remember when it was good

Moments of happiness in bloom

Maybe I just misunderstood

All of the love we left behind

Watching our flash backs intertwine

Memories I will never find

In spite of whatever you become

I think our lives have just begun

Falling away   Falling away with you

Staying awake to chase a dream
Tasting the air you're breathing in
I hope I won't forgot a thing

Promise to hold you close and pray
Watching our fantasies decay
Nothing will ever stay the same

All of the love we threw away
All of the hopes we've cherished fade
Making the same mistakes again
Making the same mistakes again

And I'll feel my world crumbling
I'll feel my life crumbling
I'll feel my soul crumbling
And falling away, falling away with you

All of the love we left behind
Watching our flash backs intertwine
Memories I will never find
Memories I will never find
