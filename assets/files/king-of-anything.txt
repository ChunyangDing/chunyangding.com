King of Anything - Sara Bareilles

C							   Dm
Keep drinking coffee, stare me down across the table
Am				F
While I look outside
C						  Dm
So many things I'd say if only I were able
	  Am							F
But I just keep quiet and count the cars that pass by
C						  Dm
You've got opinions, man, We're all entitled to 'em,
Am			F
but I never asked
		  C
So let me thank you for your time,
		Dm
And try not to waste anymore of mine
Am					F
And get out of here fast

		  Dm	
I hate to break it to you babe, 
			F
but I'm not drowning
Am					   G
There's no one here to save

Am					F
Who cares if you disagree?
		C
You are not me
			 G		 C
Who made you king of anything?
   Am				F
So you dare tell me who to be?
	C/E				  G
Who died and made you king of anything?

C - Dm - Am - F

You sound so innocent, all full of good intent
Swear you know best
But you expect me to jump up on board with you
And ride off into your delusional sunset
I'm not the one who's lost with no direction
But you'll never see
You're so busy making masks with my name on them in all caps
You got the talking down, just not the listening

(Chorus) 

	G			 Dm			   Am			
All my life I've tried to make everybody happy
	  F		 G		  Dm
While I just hurt and hide
			F						G			C
Waiting for someone to tell me it's my turn to decide

(Chorus x2)
