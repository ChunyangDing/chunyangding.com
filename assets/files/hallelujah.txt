Hallelujah
By Leonard Cohen

C Am C Am
  C					Am
I heard there was a secret chord
	 C					 Am
That David played and it pleased the Lord
		 F			 G				 C		  G
But you don't really care for music, do you?

		 C					 F			 G (slide, bar1, bar3)
Well, it goes like this, the fourth, the fifth, 
	Am				F
the minor fall, the major lift
	G			 E7			     Am
The baffled king composing hallelujah

F|Am|F| C G C
hallelujah, x4

C Am C Am

Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya

She tied you to the kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips, she drew the hallelujah
Hallelujah x4

Well baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew ya

And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah x4

Well, maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah x12
