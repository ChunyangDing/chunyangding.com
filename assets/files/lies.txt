Glen Hansard And Marketa Irglova - Lies (Guitar Chords)

DUD D / DUD D / DUD D / DUD D / D D D D 

C Am // C Am // F C F C // 
C Am // C Am // F C F C //
I think it's time, we give it up  
And figure out what's stopping us  
From breathing easy, and talking straight  
The way is clear if you're ready now  
The volunteer is slowing down  
And taking time to save himself  

Syncopated (dotted quarter/eighth) for first two bars
C Bb F // C Bb Am // F C F C Bb Am//

The little cracks they escalated  
And before you know it is too late  
For making circles and telling lies  

D DU UDU / D DU UDU / D DU UDU / D D / D D 
Am D G C C/B // Am D G C C/B

You're moving too fast for me  
And I can't keep up with you  
Maybe if you slowed down for me  
I could see you're only telling  

D / D / D // D DU UDU // D  D / D D // 
Am Am D // F C C/B // Am Am D // F C C/B Am

Lies, lies, lies  
Breaking us down with your  
Lies, lies, lies  
When will you learn  

C Am // C Am // F C F C //

The way is clear if you're ready now  
The volunteer is slowing down  
And taking time to save himself  

C Bb F // C Bb Am // F C F C Bb Am//

The little cracks they escalated  
And before you know it is too late  
For making circles and telling lies  

Am D G C C/B // Am D G C C/B 
Am Am D // F C // Am Am D // F C C/B Am

You're moving too fast for me  
And I can't keep up with you  
Maybe if you slowed down for me  
I could see you're only telling  
Lies, lies, lies  
Breaking us down with your  
Lies, lies, lies  
When will you learn  

C Am // C Am //

So plant the thought and watch it grow  
Wind it up and let it go
