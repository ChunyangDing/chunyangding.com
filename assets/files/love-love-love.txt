King Saul fell on his sword when it all went wrong
	 E									B
And Joseph's brothers sold him down the river for a song

And Sonny Liston rubbed some Tiger Balm into his glove

Some things you do for money

And some you do for love, love, love

Raskolnikov felt sick, but he couldn't say why
When he saw his face reflected in his victim's twinkling eye
Some things you'll do for money and some you'll do for fun
But the things you do for love
Are gonna to come back to you one by one

Love, love is going to lead you by the hand
Asus2			Asus2			E	E
Into a white and soundless place
Asus2	Asus2				C#m		 E
Now we see things as in a mirror dimly
Asus2		Asus2				B		E
Then we shall see each other face to face

And way out in Seattle, young Kurt Cobain
Snuck out to the greenhouse, put a bullet in his brain
Snakes in the grass beneath our feet, rain in the clouds above
Some moments last forever
But some flare out with love, love, love
