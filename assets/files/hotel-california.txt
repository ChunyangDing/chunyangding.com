Hotel California
by the Eagles

Capo 2

Am						  E7
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
G					   D
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
F						  C
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
Dm
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
E7
I had to stop for the night

Am E7 | G D | F C | Dm | E7 

There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell
And I was thinkin' to myself
'This could be heaven or this could be hell
Then she lit up a candle, And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say

F						  C
Welcome to the Hotel California
		 E7											Am
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), Such a lovely face
F								 C
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
	Dm								          E7
Any time of year (any time of year), You can find it here

Am E7 | G D | F C | Dm | E7 

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, She got the Mercedes Benz, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, Some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain, "Please bring me my wine"
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night, Just to hear them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), Bring your alibis

Am E7 | G D | F C | Dm | E7 

Mirrors on the ceiling, The pink champagne on ice
And she said, "We are all just prisoners here of our own device"
And in the master's chambers, They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives, But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back, To the place I was before
"Relax", said the night man, "We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like, But you can never leave"
