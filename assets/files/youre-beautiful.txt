Messiah, You're Beautiful
by Paul Wickham

Capo 6

Basically just G C Em D over and over again

Strumming: D DU D DUDUDUD

G					C
I see Your face in every sunrise
	Em						     D
The colors of the morning are inside Your eyes
G						   C
The world awakens in the light of the day
   Em					D (one strum)
I look up to the sky and say: You're beautiful
 
G C Em D
OooOooOOooOo

I see Your power in the moonlit night
Where planets are in motion and galaxies are bright
We are amazed in the light of the stars
It's all proclaiming who You are: You're beautiful

I see You there hanging on a tree
You bled and then You died and then You rose again for me
Now You are sitting on Your heavenly throne
Soon we will be coming home: You're beautiful

When we arrive at eternity's shore
Where death is just a memory and tears are no more
We'll enter in as the wedding bells ring
Your bride will come together and we'll sing
You're beautiful

I see Your face,
You're beautiful, You're beautiful, You're beautiful
