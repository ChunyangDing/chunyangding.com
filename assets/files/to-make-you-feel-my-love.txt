To Make You Feel My Love
Capo 3

G  | D | F     | C 
Cm | G | A7 D7 | G

G						 D
When the rain is blowing in your face
F					   C
And the whole world is on your case
Cm					 G
I could offer you a warm embrace
A7			 D7				G
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

[Bridge]

C							 G
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
B7						   G
But I would never do you wrong
C							  G
I've known it from the moment that we met
A7							     D7
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry; I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

G  | D | F     | C 
Cm | G | A7 D7 | G

[Bridge]
C							 G
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
B7						G
And on the highway of regret
C								 G
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
A7								D7
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love
